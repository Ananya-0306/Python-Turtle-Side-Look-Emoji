# Python-Turtle-Side-Look-Emoji
import turtle


This is very easy to code and create. First, we have imported the turtle and then we have initialized it.
Then we created it first eye which is looking our left side using circle() function in python turtle, and in the same way we have created the second eye. At last, we just draw it’s lips(mouth) by drawing a line. To draw that line, we first changed the postion of our pen using goto() function and then just changed it’s size to 10 using pensize() function.

This is very easy and simple to create Side Look Emoji. We have also used some other function like color(), begin_fill(), end_fill(), etc. These all are easy to understand because the names of these functions tell the purpose of them themselves.
Just try this program, and let us know if you have any queries or problems in that.
